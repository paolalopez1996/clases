    <p style="text-align:center" >Took a breath, let it go
        Felt the moment settle so
        I couln't wait to tell you why
        I'm standin' here with this awkward smile
        And that's because... </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">I could drown myself in someone like you
            I could dive so deep I never come out
            I thought it was impossible
            But you make it possible</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">Love, it stings and then it laughs
                At every beat of my battered heart
                A sudden jolt, a tender kiss
                I know I'm gonna die of this
                And that's because</p>
                <p style="text-align:center" >I could drown myself in someone like you
                    I could dive so deep I never come out
                    I thought it was impossible
                    But you make it possible</p>
                    <p style="text-align:center" >I'll take the smooth with the rough
                        Feels so fucked up to be in love
                        Another day, another night
                        Stuck in my own head but you pull me out
                        You pull me out</p>

                            <p style="text-align:center"  >Somebody told me and I think they're right
                                There is a change on its way tonight
                                And I feel it's so
                                But I fear it though</p>
