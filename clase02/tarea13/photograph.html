    <h2>Letra:</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center" >Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
        But it's the only thing that I know
        When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
        It is the only thing makes us feel alive</p>
        <p style="text-align:center" >We keep this love in a photograph
            We made these memories for ourselves
            Where our eyes are never closing
            Hearts are never broken
            And time's forever frozen, still</p>
            <p  style="text-align:center">So you can keep me
                Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
                Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
                You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home</p>
                <p  style="text-align:center">Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
                    And it's the only thing that I know, know
                    I swear it will get easier
                    Remember that with every piece of ya
                    Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die</p>
                    <p  style="text-align:center">Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
                        We made these memories for ourselves
                        Where our eyes are never closing
                        Hearts were never broken
                        And time's forever frozen, still</p>
                        <p  style="text-align:center">So you can keep me
                            Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
                            Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
                            You won't ever be alone</p>
                            <p  style="text-align:center">And if you hurt me
                                That's okay, baby, only words bleed
                                Inside these pages, you just hold me
                                And I won't ever let you go
                                Wait for me to come home
                                Wait for me to come home
                                Wait for me to come home
                                Wait for me to come home</p>
                                <p  style="text-align:center">Oh, you can fit me
                                    Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
                                    Next to your heartbeat where I should be
                                    Keep it deep within your soul</p>
                                    <p style="text-align:center" >  And if you hurt me
                                        Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
                                        Inside these pages, you just hold me
                                        And I won't ever let you go</p>
                                        <p  style="text-align:center">When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
                                            Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
                                            Hearing you whisper through the phone
                                            "Wait for me to come home"</p>
